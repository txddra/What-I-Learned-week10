## This week in `Code Immersives` lore...

We've covered :
- **Objects**
     
     &

- **JSON**

### [Objects](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_objects.asp):

- An object has properties (or *variables*) associated with it.
- The properties of an object define the characteristics of the object.
  - Accessing Properties on an Object

There are two ways to access properties on an object:

   - Dot Notation
      -``let obj = {
  cat: 'meow',
  dog: 'woof'
};let sound = obj.cat;console.log(sound);
// meow

`` 

  - Bracket Notation
     - ``let obj = {
  cat: 'meow',
  dog: 'woof'
};let sound = obj['cat'];console.log(sound);
// meow 
``

### [_JSON_](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_json.asp):

**JSON** stands for **J**ava**S**cript **O**bject **N**otation


*a couple of quick facts*:

 - Data is in name/value pairs
      - ` "firstName":"John" `
 - Data is separated by commas
      - `{"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"} `
- Curly braces hold objects
- Square brackets hold arrays
     - `` "employees":[
    {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"},
    {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"},
    {"firstName":"Peter", "lastName":"Jones"}
]``
 
- and is *apparently* easy to read and understand*
