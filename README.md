## This week in `Code Immersives` lore...

We've covered :
- **Objects**
     
     &

- **JSON**
  
---
!
### [_JSON_](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_json.asp):

**JSON** stands for **J**ava**S**cript **O**bject **N**otation


*a couple of quick facts*:

 - Data is in name/value pairs
      - ` "firstName":"John" `
 - Data is separated by commas
      - `{"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"} `
- Curly braces hold objects
- Square brackets hold arrays
     - ```javascript "employees":[
    {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"},
    {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"},
    {"firstName":"Peter", "lastName":"Jones"}
]```
